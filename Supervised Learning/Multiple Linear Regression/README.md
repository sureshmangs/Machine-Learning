# Multiple Linear Regression

`Regression` is a statistical approach to find the relationship between variables.In machine learning, it is used to predict the outcome of an event based on the relationship between variables obtained from the data-set. Regression models are used to predict a continuous value.

`Multiple regression` is an extension of simple `linear regression`.

 It is used when we want to predict the value of a variable based on the value of two or more variables.
